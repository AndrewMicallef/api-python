Directory unittests

This directory contains the unit tests.  To run an individual test,
type:
python <test.py>

To run all the test, run bash script:
./run_tests.sh


When run, each test will first output a validation report for
the created NWB file.  After that will be a message indicating
whether or not the test PASSES or not.

Ignore the valdation report for the purposes of determing
if the test passes.
